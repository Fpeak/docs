A deployment is the end result of building your project and making it available to visitors.

This section contains information about making, managing and understanding the behavior of deployments.

## Making Deployments

### ZEIT Dashboard

## Deployment Types

There are two types of deployment on the ZEIT Now platform, **staging** and **production**.

### Staging

**Staging deployments** are the default for all deployments. Each time you push to a branch or make a deployment using the `now` command, this is a **staging deployment**.

By making a **staging deployment**, the **staging domain** will be updated to reflect that of the latest deployment made.

The **staging domain** is provided either by the deployment output from Now CLI or on a pull request when using a git integration and contains the name of the user or team the project belongs to.

### Production

**Production deployments** are made in two different circumstances. Each time you merge to the default branch (commonly `master`) or make a deployment using the `now --prod` command, this is a **production deployment**.

By making a **production deployment**, the **production domain(s)** will be updated to reflect that of the latest deployment made.

The **production domain(s)** are defined from the **Domains** tab of a project on the ZEIT Dashboard.

## Special Paths

All deployment URLs have two special pathnames:

- `/_src`
- `/_logs`

### Source view

By appending `/_src` to a [deployment URL](/docs/v2/advanced/concepts/urls) or [custom domain](/docs/v2/custom-domains), the deployment inspector will be open and you'll be able to browse your deployment sources and [build](/docs/v2/advanced/builders) outputs.

### Logs view

By appending `/_logs` to a [deployment URL](/docs/v2/advanced/concepts/urls) or [custom domain](/docs/v2/custom-domains), you will be able to see a realtime stream of logs from your deployment build processes and serverless invocations.

### Security considerations

These pathnames redirect to `https://zeit.co` and _require logging in_ to access any sensitive information. A 3rd-party can _never_ access your source or logs by crafting a deployment URL with one of these paths.
